Z-Wave device handle for August Pro Smart Lock device handler with door sense.

Based on Smartthings "Z-Wave Lock" example from Smartthings New Device Handler wizard.

### Why use it?

You should use this device handler if you have a August Lock Pro and you want to use door sense in automations.

### Child door sensor
Due to a bug in Smartthings, only a child device can be used on standart automation app.
